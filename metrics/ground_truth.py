"""Ground-truth posteriors p(x | y*) by rejection sampling, cached to disk.

Both forward processes are deterministic, y = f(x). To get a proper likelihood
we treat the observation as y | x ~ N(f(x), sigma^2 I) with a small fixed sigma
(GT_SIGMA, per benchmark), and sample

    x ~ prior,   accept with probability  exp(-||f(x) - y*||^2 / (2 sigma^2)).

This is exact rejection sampling from p(x | y*) under that likelihood (the
acceptance probability is the likelihood divided by its maximum, 1).

Choice of sigma (identical for every y* and every model):
  kinematics  sigma = 0.01. y* spans roughly [-1.3, 2.0] x [-2.2, 2.2]. The
      ground-truth samples themselves then have a re-simulation error of
      2 sigma^2 = 2e-4, well below the best Err_resim in Table 1 (0.008), and
      the induced blur in x is about 0.01, below the smallest MMD bandwidth
      (0.05), so the kernel cannot resolve it.
  ballistics  sigma = 0.02. y* spans [0, 21]. The upstream forward process
      reports the impact at the last point of a 1500-step time grid, so f is
      piecewise constant with steps of roughly 0.01-0.03 in y. A much smaller
      sigma would only resolve that discretization, not the physics. Ground
      truth re-simulation error sigma^2 = 4e-4 vs. 0.019 best in Table 2.

The proposals are shared between the y*: each chunk of prior samples is pushed
through f once and matched against all pending y* with a KD-tree over f(x)
(neighbors within 4 sigma; exp(-8) ~ 3e-4 of the likelihood mass is cut off).
Within one y* the accepted samples are i.i.d. from the posterior; across y*
they may share proposals, which does not bias the per-y* estimate.

A y* far in the tails of p(y) may not reach N_GT accepted samples before
max_proposals. Its posterior is then estimated from fewer samples (counted in
the result; MMD with the unbiased estimator handles unequal set sizes).
